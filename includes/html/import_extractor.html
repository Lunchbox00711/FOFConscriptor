<h3>Import Ratings Data</h3>

<p>To import ratings data, you need to export the scout data from Front Office Football using the option at the bottom of the Almanac menu in FOF7 version 7.0b+.  This will be in a .csv file ("draft_personal.csv" most likely).  When you import this file, the player bars as well
as the data from your interviews will be visible in all your player lists.</p>

<p><form method="post" action="import_draft_bars_run.php" enctype="multipart/form-data">

    <p>draft_personal.csv: <input type="file" name="team_players"></p>

<p><b>NOTE:</b> Importing a draft file will erase any existing data you have imported!</p>

    <p><input type="submit" value="Upload" onclick="return confirm('Importing a new draft file will delete any existing data!

Are you sure you want to do this?')"></p>

</form>
