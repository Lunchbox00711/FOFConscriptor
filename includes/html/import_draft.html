<h2>FOF7 Import</h2><p>In FOF7 there is a staff draft and a player draft.  To start either draft you need to export data from FOF7 using the export option under the Almanac menu.  Then upload the staff.csv or rookies.csv file depending on which draft you wish to run, the universe_info.csv file for draft order, and the team_information.csv file for team ID mapping to city names. If this is a rookie draft then I also need the player_information file to get theirbirthdays.  If this is a staff draft then I also need last season's transactions CSV file to make sure newly signed or fired staff members are amenable to new positions where appropriate.</p><p><form method="post" action="import_fof7_draft_run.php" enctype="multipart/form-data">	<p>staff.csv or rookies.csv: <input type="file" name="draft"></p>	<p>universe_info.csv: <input type="file" name="draft_order"></p>	<p>team_information.csv: <input type="file" name="team_info"></p>        <p>(rookie draft) player_information.csv: <input type="file" name="player_info"></p>	<p>(staff draft) Last season's transactions_XXXX.csv: <input type="file" name="transactions"></p>	<p><input type="submit" value="Import New Draft" onclick="return confirm('Importing a new draft file will delete any existing draft!
