<h3>FOF7 Import Mock Draft Data</h3>
<p>To create a mock draft and allow for scout picks there are 2 more files I need that were generated by 
    running the Export Data option under the Almanac menu.  The player_record.csv file maps players to team 
rosters.  Then upload the latest player_ratings_season_XXXX.csv file to match current ratings to those players. 
With this information the utility will have an understanding of position needs for each team.</p>
<p>Once the files are uploaded the mock draft will run.</p>
<p><form method="post" action="import_mock_draft_run.php" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <p>player_record.csv: <input type="file" name="player_to_team"></p>
    <p>player_ratings_season_XXXX.csv: <input type="file" name="player_ratings"></p>
    <p><input type="submit" value="Upload" name="upload"></p>
