************************************************************************************



Version 0.1



Initial Release



---------------------



Version 0.4



Added filters for the players and selections

Fixed the draft order import if a team lost their draft pick (and are listed as 'xxx')



---------------------



Version 0.5



Added the ability to send e-mail notifications for each pick.  A global e-mail may be set

by editing the config.inc.php file, or each team may sign up in the options section.



Added a button to re-number your priority list in multiples of 10 for easy re-arranging



Enabled deleting of selections in the priority page



Made the player gray and italic in the priority list if their priority is 0



Fixed the importer so it doesn't break when there are commas in the school name



---------------------



Version 0.6



Fixed the e-mail notification, in version 0.5 it only sent if there was a global

e-mail notifcation set.



Added the ability for the admin to change the team that is selecting in a given round.



Added the admin e-mail account, which will be sent all draft notifications as well as

will be the e-mail address that the notifications come from.



---------------------



Version 0.7



Gave the admin account the ability to clear passwords or lock teams out by assigning

a random password (for AI teams, for example).  This area also shows the number of

players in each team's queue.



Gave the team an option to turn autopick off.  The admin can turn it back on if they are

waiting on the team.  When autopick is off, the team may select the player from the "Priority"

screen directly.



---------------------



Version 0.8



Tracking the time that each team is on the clock and reporting it in the header



Put more information about each player on the players screen



The option to zero out the priority of a position after you have selected a player of that position

is now able to be turned off



The admin may now stop the draft at any pick



The admin may now roll back the draft, returning players to the board



Teams may choose to make a player list or a list of "Best Player Available" based on general score

or by any of the other values that are recorded for the players.



-----------------------



Version 0.9



Added a chat feature



-----------------------



Version 0.10



Fixed a bug that caused the BPA selections to mess up if the attempted pick has already been selected



-----------------------



Version 0.11



Fixed a bug where if you had another app on the server using the session variable 'login' it would

mess up the logging in process for Conscriptor



-----------------------



Version 0.12



Restricted the team name field when registering to 3 characters



-----------------------



Version 0.13



The admin now can see the full chat transcript with time stamps.  Individual users will only see

the area of the chat while they are logged in.



Changed the player pick function to prevent a potential race condition if there are more than one

admin and they both pick for the same team at the same time (with two different players)



Added the ability for the admin to view any team's player queue



Added the ability for the admin to skip a team's pick, in the event that they run out of time

and the admin does not want to pick for them.  Skipping a pick will allow that team to come back

and make a selection at any time.



-----------------------



Version 0.14



Teams can now send their pick to another team.



Added the actual pick number next to the round-pick display.



Added the ability to add comments to players in your priority list.



-----------------------



Version 0.15



Added the team 'xxx' to the list.  This allows the admin to remove a draft pick.



Enabled the comments and "make selection" on the player list (so you don't have to add them to

your priority list to do those things)



The chat now pops up on all screens as it is happening.



Changed the e-mails so that they are a single BCC e-mail instead of sending individual

e-mails to each team.  This will hopefully fix the issue where the database was timing out

on some servers because it was taking so long for the e-mails to be sent.  Also made it so

that the admin can turn off the e-mails if it still times out the server (and made the

default setting to be e-mails off)



Added the ability for the picks to have a time limit and be automatically skipped.  Also

added a clock where the time limit applies.



------------------------



Version 0.16



The admin still gets e-mail notices even if the e-mail is turned off.



Added the ability for each team's clock to be adjusted by a percentage of the regular pick clock.



Teams now can choose what columns they want to display in the lists.



Added all columns that Extractor exports as available for the lists.  Some of course will not be applicable,

depending on whether you are doing a full draft or an amateur draft.  This includes the bar values!



Changed BPA to use the bar values.



Allowed the user to upload their own Extractor export so that they can see their scout's impression



Fixed a bug that caused a manual pick to fill a prior skipped pick.  Priority picks worked fine.



------------------------



Version 0.17



Added the player detail page.



------------------------



Version 0.18



The position drill was changed from a bar to just the value on the player info page.



Changed it so that the draft must be stopped to change the pick time and window, as doing that during a running

draft would cause unpredictable results.



Added an experience limit to the BPA selection method



Added the ability for the admin to add teams



Added combine color coding to match the in-game colors.  Also added height and weight comments on the player details.



------------------------



Version 1.0



Added a private chat feature.



Added sound effects to the chat.  Sounds are in the mp3 folder and may be replaced with any mp3 file.



Added an asterisk to the team name if they are set to autopick and have players in their queue.



Modified the admin user list so that they can see whether a team has a Player List queue or a BPA queue,

and how many active selections are in that queue.



Changed the draft uploader to not delete existing teams.



------------------------



Version 1.1



Importing a new draft did not clear the comments from the previous draft.



------------------------



Version 1.2



Fixed a bug in the importer that was assigning positional values incorrectly.



Fixed a bug that was displaying the player rating incorrectly (if the player was not a rookie).



Added a general "notes" tab for teams to write notes to themselves not specific to any player.



Added the ability to upload the grade/adjusted grade info.  This is optional but helpful.



Added the "Adjusted Grade" criteria to the BPA.



------------------------



Version 1.3



Added an analyzer dump to the menu.



Changed it so that if you are not logged in, you still can see the selections.



Added the ability to automatically add the 0-priority players to the end of your priority list.



Added the option for teams who time out on the clock to have their selection made automatically, using

the following logic: 1) If they have a player queue but have their auto-pick off, it picks from the queue.

2) If not, it will pick the best player available at a position that they have not selected yet in the

draft.  If there are no players that fit that criteria (i.e. all positions have been selected), then it

picks the best player available.



Fixed a bug that would turn off the countdown clock if you changed options while the draft clock was running.



Added a checkbox to filter out overrated playes in the players list.



Added the ability to go to the previous/next in your priority queue from the player info page.



------------------------



Version 1.4



Fixed the analyzer dump so it displays in a new window instead of downloading to a text file.



Fixed the bars for TE, Endurance and Special Teams were missing, Long Snapping was assigned to Endurance.



Fixed the birthday display, all birthdays were showing as the 12th of the month.



Added the ability to delay the autopick by up to thirty minutes.



Added a widget that can be embedded on a league homepage.



------------------------



Version 1.5



Added an option for e-mails to only be sent to the team that is on the clock, in addition to the existing

all picks and no e-mails.



------------------------



Version 1.6



Fixed a bug where comments made on the player info page were not saved correctly.



------------------------



Version 1.7



Allowing persistent logins.



------------------------



Version 1.8



Fixed a bug that was showing the "rating" value as the most recently uploaded team's scout impression.

Other bars were not affected.



------------------------



Version 1.9



Changed the analyzer dump to display the line breaks correctly



------------------------



Version 1.10



Put the timestamp on the chat for everyone (previously the admin only had the timestamp).



Named the text box for the chat a random name so that it doesn't autofill your chat text.



Added some verification to the Extractor upload so you can't upload old versions of the Extractor (which caused

corrupt data) and also let you know if you uploaded the wrong file (no players matched).



Fixed a logic bug that caused a team to autopick immediately if they had autopick turned off and 0 as the

autopick wait time.



Corrected an error in the calculations of the pick time limit if the team goes on the clock but the time

needs to wrap around to the next day.



------------------------



Version 1.11



Fixed a bug in the auto-picking where if a delay was set and the team's expiration time went into the next day,

the pick would wait until the next day to fire.



Fixed the analyzer dump to display picks in order and give scrollbars.



Writes to the error log the details of any changed pick.



If a team has a delay on their autopick it now shows in the selections list next to the asterisk.



The user tab in the admin now displays the number of times a team has had their time expire.



Fixed the "reorder priority list appending players with 0 to the end of the list."  Previously it was

also sorting the existing list in adjusted grade order, then appending the 0-priority players in

adjusted grade order.



Gave the option for when a pick goes on the clock and will expire after the end of the day's pick

to either keep the same pick time or roll into the next day.



Fixed the admin options to enable turning the 24-hour clock back on



Fixed the "keep me signed in" cookie so that if an incorrect password is entered it doesn't get stuck

in an infinite redirect loop.



Changed the chat so that when you first log in it pulls the chat from the previous two hours

rather than just when you first log in.



Keeps track of the number of teams each team has run out of time and been autopicked.



The admin can now have the pick time limit reduce for any team whose time expires.  This value is

a percentage, so having it set to 0% will have no reduction, 50% will have the time cut in half

each time (with a one hour limit the first miss will reduce their time to 30 minutes, the second to 15,

the third to 7, and so on), 100% will immediately take that team to an immediate pick for all future

selections.



Fixed the user list when sorted by the clock adjustment.

.

------------------------



Version 1.12



Added the ability to change the time zone for the draft times.  Changing during a draft may cause strange

things to happen with the chat (users may appear to be online who are not).  I only put in the US time zones,

but if you want to add time zones you may by adding entries in the time_zone table.  You will get an error

message if the time zone you entered does not have valid data.  If you get this error using the built-in time

zones, you may not be able to use this feature.  To use the time zone of your system, just set the time zone

to "Use Server's Time Zone."



------------------------



Version 1.13



Changed the BPA algorithm to use the current rating, then future rating for players who don't have an adjusted grade

(this is for full drafts).



------------------------



Version 1.14



Changed the max for the formation bar for a QB to 17.



Added the ability to import the Popularity value that is exported from the Interrogator.



------------------------



Version 1.15



Fixed the player popularity tell column to be distinguished from the regular player popularity column.



------------------------



Version 1.16



Fixed the Daylight Saving Time bug (you have to now select EDT or EST for the time zone)



------------------------



Version 1.17



Fixed a bug where the admin user list was showing the player queue count incorrectly



------------------------



Version 1.18



Fixed the player rating on the player card page.



Fixed the player rating on the list so that if a team hasn't uploaded an extractor report,

it shows the initial uploaded values.



------------------------



Version 1.19



You can now upload an extractor export of the entire league and do a mock draft.  This will

also enable scout picks, which will pick based on the team's strengths.



Added the ability to limit the autopick delay.



------------------------



Version 1.20



Forced picks now ignore P and K unless all other positions have been selected.



Enabled "current rating" and "future rating" in BPA lists (for allocation drafts)



Randomized the scout pick somewhat, so that the mock draft doesn't always match the actual selections.



------------------------



Version 1.21



Clearing a team's password also clears the e-mail address.



------------------------



Version 1.22



Clearing a team's password sets their clock adjustment value to 0.  Setting a dummy password also

sets their clock adjustment value to 0.  When a team registers, their clock adjustment value

is set to 100%.



Mock draft now has commentary on each pick.



------------------------



Version 1.23



Fixed a bug where the mock draft/scout pick would break if the player list was not uploaded

in adjusted grade order.  Some 1.22.X versions may have problems.



Added the ability to adjust the weight for each position for the scout picks.



------------------------



Version 1.24



Apostrophes in the team name broke the mock draft.



Adding a link for text for posting the first round in a forum.



Added some more phrases to the AI.



------------------------



Version 1.25



The chat page now scrolls to the end of the chat when loaded.



"Show Attributes" and "Filter Overrated" now stay checked if you select players from the players list.



New pick method option: Player Queue then Best At Position.  Selecting this option will use your player queue

until it is empty, and then will use the BPA queue.



------------------------



Version 1.26



Added effects to the alert messages.



Added some debugging code for developer troubleshooting.



Removing all now() functions in the MySQL code, instead having PHP do all the time calculations.  This should prevent

the PHP and MySQL clock from getting out of sync.



Adding a bell tone when you go on the clock.



Passwords are now encrypted



------------------------



Version 1.27



Previous versions were expecting magic quotes to be on.  This allowed for SQL injection attacks if

magic quotes is off, and magic quotes is being depreciated.  The app now tests for magic quotes

and, if off, adds slashes to the input.



------------------------



Version 1.27.2



Turned autocomplete off for the chat



------------------------



Version 1.27.3



Locking the database when the pick calculations are run.  This prevents a race condition

where picks were choosing two of the same position, even though the team had the checkbox

on to zero out players of the same position.



------------------------



Version 1.27.4



Changed to use MooTools, modified the chat code to hopefully be more stable and consistent



------------------------



Version 1.27.5



Changed the pick processing to prevent a race condition where multiple e-mails were being sent

on each pick



Making the e-mail notification subject the same for all e-mails (removing the round and pick number)



------------------------



Version 1.28



Owners can now choose whether they receive all e-mails or just the e-mails when they go on the clock.

The admin's options override the owner's if the admin sets it to only send e-mails to the team on the clock

or none at all.



------------------------



Version 1.28.1



Priority list is now sortable by dragging and dropping.  Also added a quick-add function.



------------------------



Version 1.28.2



Fixed a bug that was preventing the autopicks to fire



------------------------



Version 1.28.3



Chat had broken around 1.28 I believe, it should be fixed now.



------------------------



Version 1.28.4



Including a json_encode class for the quick search on PHP < 5.2



------------------------



Version 1.28.5



Pick queue was limiting itself to 32 (or whatever you happened to have previously saved the number of rows

displayed as)



Giving a count of the players in the priority list



Adding players to the queue now puts them into the end of the active queue instead of the beginning



------------------------



Version 1.28.6



Removed the "click" sound for chat



Fixed an SQL injection vunerlability



------------------------



Version 1.28.7



Added functionality to import from Draft Analyzer

Added a "clear inactives" button to the priority list to quickly remove inactive players



-----------------------



Version 1.4



Admin can configure other Users as draft admins to assist with the draft in addition to their regular GM tasks.



Issue with chat overloading the server hopefully fixed by reducing the frequency of draft updates (60s) and creating a message update table to limit more time-intensive sql queries.



Added emoticons to the chat



Added GM name tracking



Added buttons to the priority screen so that users do not have to use the drag and drop feature (such as when using iOS or other mobile devices).



-----------------------



Version 1.5



Added ability to modify pick timeout values for each round individually beforehand.





-----------------------



Version 1.5.1



Fixed the priority buttons.  They only worked in IE.



Modified the Import Extractor output so that GM draft admins still get the team specific page and only the admin gets the draft setup version.



-----------------------



Version 1.5.2



Fixed the install.sql script which created the last_update table with a wrong collumn (should have been latest_message).

Changed "Selected" header to "Priority List" on the players page.

Fixed the missing "Add to Priority List" button on the player detail page.

Fixed private chat invitations not being received unless the sender submitted a message with the invitation.

Added notes to indicate that private chat invitations may take 1min for delivery as a neccessary evil tied to draft_update checks and keeping the server operating smoothly.

Added button to move player to top of priority queue.



-----------------------



Version 1.5.3



Fixed Draft Admin email settings being tied to overall draft email settings.

Fixed Draft Admin being unable to select for team on player list screen.

Removed Chat option following report of downed draft due to server overload.  May revisit.



-----------------------



Version 1.6



Added SMS Text message updates for AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, Nextel, TMobile, and US Cellular - US Domestic only.

Replaced chat option with a dynamicly created EveryWhereChat room.  Users still have to elect a nickname, but no account creation is needed.

It does not appear to be neccessary to register the chat room, but there could be advantages to doing so.

Below is copied from the EveryWhereChat website regarding room setup.

	Instructions:

	    Sign on to the chat room with a nickname you want to use ( some names may be taken)

	    After loading your chat room, double click your name in the member's list to register it.

	    Now that your name is registered you can click on the Room Settings button at the top of the chat to register your room.

	    Your room is now registered, use the Room Settings button to add moderators or change settings.



----------------------



Version 1.6.2



GMs can change their usernames

Links can be assigned to GMs which are displayed on the selection page (links to user profile or PM)

Added import of other hidden attributes like intelligence, loyalty, play for winner, personality as part of the popularity import.



----------------------



Version 1.6.3



Added player DOB to player page

Updated install.sql script to include the draft_admin collumn in the team table

Fixed the default page which kicked out a 500 error instead of the clean install page due to an uninitiated variable.



----------------------



Version 1.7



Added an "(online)" indicator next to GM names when the GM is active in the utility.



Added option for admins to select between the flash chat or the original chat option.  If there are server issues with

the original chat then use the flash chat version or replace the content of /includes/html/chat.html with a link to

your own site's chat page and that should effectively integrate it with the utility.



Revised the email system to allow admins to select between several sending options.  The old system used PHP's mail()

command which is notoriously unreliable.  Admins should use sendmail() first, but if it doesn't work then try setting

up an SMTP connection with your email account info, THEN fall back to the mail() command option.



-----------------------



Version 1.7b



Fixed bug where draft admins would not see queues for GMs with the "Player Queue and Best At Position" option selected.



Now allow draft admins to view GMs queues for their currently selected autopick method even if their autopick is currently off.



Added option to allow site admins to turn email off for GMs and only receive rollback notifications.



-----------------------



Version 1.7c



Fixed bug where SMTP password was being overwritten with ***** values when it was not changed.



Fixed bug where rollback would work correctly but generate an error to the admin running the rollback.



-----------------------



Version 1.8



Added Chat Template option where admins can set the chat system to use their own chat code.



Moved "has password" on Users tab to far left and added highlights to those without a password to be more obvious that the team

has yet to register.



Disabled GM notification options when the admin has turned email off so that GMs know why they aren't getting notifications.



Added popup message when clicking on a players DOB that indicates what birthdays the player would have affinities with.



----------------------



Version 1.8.1



Broke out admin email settings from overall email amount settings.  Admins can now select to receive no email independent of the GM email settings.



Incorporated a bug fix from 1.8b removing the setup for an "X picks away" notification that was causing issues.



----------------------



Version 1.8.2



Fixed the following bugs:

1) Rollback would throw an error for trying to send an email to a blank email address if a GM somehow stores a blank email address in the database. Likely occurred in the draft admin page.

2) Setting Chat disabled forced email disabled and causes lots of issues.

3) Using the "mail()" email system and minimal email settings caused an error to be thrown if it tries to send an email to nobody. Safe to ignore for now. You should use sendmail() if possible.

4) GM Options showed an invalid phone number message even when you're not setting the phone number. Annoying.



----------------------



Version 1.8.3



Added more error checking to prevent mail() from trying to send an email to nobody.

Added private_chat.html to the distribution.



----------------------



Version 1.8.4



Changed the email sending loop so that it sends individual emails instead of a group BCC.  This allows mail() to work as it

wants at least one explicit TO.



----------------------



Version 1.8.5



Moved queue processing ahead of email processing in functions.inc.php since email errors where causing queues to not update.

Added exception catch clauses when sending email to allow execution to continue in the event of an error.



----------------------



Version 1.8.6



Added = to chat_text.php so that updates work correctly with the built-in chat

Added error checking to functions.inc.php for situations when email or sms notification is on but the email or phone number is empty

Added new default settings to set email and sms notifications to OFF for all teams when importing a new draft.



----------------------



Version 1.8.7



Fixed error introduced in 1.8.1 where email is turned off when draft admins save draft options



Fixed bug occurring when email is disabled and mock draft is not run where email would not be sent and the on-the-clock team will not

have their pick times populated correctly resulting in a hung draft where the admin had to start/stop the draft to set the timer for the next pick.



----------------------



Version 1.8.8



Adjusted PHP chat to have team names and nicknames both shown on the chat window and for chat history shown when chat page is loaded.

Currently just a zip of the updated files.



----------------------



Version 1.9



Switched auto-pick to off by default on draft setup.

Implemented a force auto pick button.



----------------------



Version 2.1



Switched to FOF7 and implemented staff and allocation draft options.



----------------------



Version 2.2



Modified allocation draft to use new table mapping FOF7 export columns to Conscriptor attribute IDs.

This reduced the size of player_to_attribute table on import from 170,000 rows to ~30,000 and prevented page

timeouts experienced by initial testing during import.



----------------------



Version 2.3



Fixed bug where if player queue and/or BPA selected and list empty and time expires or forced then the pick 

is skipped instead of a player picked by force.



Removed requirement of matching DOB on priority list import since rookies do not have DOB exported currently in FOF7.



----------------------



Version 2.3.1



Fixed bug where positions selected are not moved to inactive when "zero out priority" is enabled introduced when

implementing staff draft.



----------------------



Version 2.4



Fixed bug where traded picks still were reported as owned by the original team.

Fixed bug where unemployed staff would not show up if the XXX utility user in_game_id was not set to 99.

Fixed bug where Arizona staff also showed up as admin or xxx staff if in_game_id values were not set properly by the utility to -1 and 99 respectively.

Fixed bug where expired contract staff members were considered still employed since the export listed their former team as current employer.

Fixed bug where staff pick could not be made manually after the first round.

Fixed bug where rollback caused formerly drafted staff members to not be selectable when the draft restarted.

Fixed bug where rollback caused formerly fired staff members to not be reinstated to their former teams.

Updated to support new export format of FOF7.0a.

Updated to change from arbitrary staff transaction input file numbers to using the year column now exported in FOF7.0a

Updated to capture the formations for active QBs when running an allocation draft.

Updated to capture rookie birthdays by cross-referencing Player_ID with player_information.csv.



----------------------



Version 2.4.1



Fixed bug where Arizona (or team with in-game ID of 0) does not show up in the selections filter dropdown list but team 'admin' does.



----------------------



Version 2.4.2



Modified the player detail URLs to use the player_id from within FOF7 so that leagues could create their own player pages that link to Conscriptor.



----------------------



Version 2.5



Fixed bug introduced in 2.4.2 where the left and right player detail navigation was no longer correct.

Added ability for GMs to upload extractor output to have their own staff's view of rookie skill bar values.



----------------------

Version 2.5.1



Added an extra newline to draft CSV file since FOF 7.0a was not recognizing the 7.32 pick.

Added Draft Analyzer compatible output to the status line in addition to the CSV output.

----------------------

Version 2.5.2

Fixed bug introduced in 2.4.2 where selections and priority pages player/staff detail URLs no longer worked.
Fixed several staff issues, but it needs a redesign.  Not recommending any league use it at this time.

----------------------

Version 2.5.3

Fixed bug introduced in 2.4.2 where mock draft player detail URLs no longer worked.
Fixed bug where Analyzer output did not include a newline.
Updated GM player ratings import to use FOF7 generated files instead of requiring another utility like Extractor to pull the data out first.

----------------------

Version 2.6

*****Reworked staff draft to display 5 priority lists.  Still under construction.
Big thanks to Aston for this hotfix version fixing the bug where penalized draft picks were not processed properly, and other issues too.

----------------------

Version 2.7

Added another Aston fix for dual round picks with one traded away not being imported properly.

.1

Fixed wrapper_chat.html back to wrapper.html in page.inc.php.
